## crow (6.7k)

Source: https://github.com/ipkn/crow

Since above official source seems to be dead right now as i faced issue as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ipkn/crow/issues/387). So I am following this maintainer fork >>>>>[here](https://github.com/CrowCpp/crow)<<<<<.

How I installed crow in my archlinux ?

I just coped the include folder from above repo to my project's folder and it works simply. FYI: I needed to add `-Iinclude` flag to `g++` command so it takes include folder while compiling.
